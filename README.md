# Projects Page

This project is a test assignment that I completed within 8 hours. The task was to envision how a Projects page would look like and implement it using React, while independently choosing the necessary libraries. To fetch data, I created a mock database using JSON Placeholder.

During the development process, I focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing Projects page, showcasing my skills in React and front-end development. The goal was to demonstrate my ability to handle data, create reusable components, and implement an intuitive user interface.

Please note that this is a test project and may not have full functionality or real data. It serves as a demonstration of my technical capabilities and problem-solving skills within the given time constraints.

## Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
Redux Toolkit: An opinionated state management library for efficient and scalable Redux development.
React Router v6: A declarative routing library for React applications.
Tailwind: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom user interfaces.

## Project Structure
  public/ directory in a React project contains the static assets and files that are served as-is to the client without any processing or transformations.
    index.html: This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your React application.
    
  src/  directory is the main source directory of  project
    components/: This directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the application.
    pages/: This subdirectory contains components specific to different pages of the application
    hooks/: This directory houses custom hooks that provide reusable functionality across components, such as fetching data or handling authentication.
    interfaces/: This directory is for defining TypeScript interfaces or types that define the shape of data used in the application, such as Recipe and User.
    slices/: This directory is where you can define Redux Toolkit slices, which contain the actions and reducers for managing state in your application.
    store/: This directory holds the Redux store configuration, including the root reducer and any middleware or enhancers.
    images/: This directory is used to store images and other media assets used in the application.
    index.tsx: This is the entry point of your application, where you typically render the root component and mount it in the DOM.
    index.css: Global CSS file
